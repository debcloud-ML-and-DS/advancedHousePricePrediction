## Overview:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Problem Definition:
Build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based in Ames and Iowa.

## Evaluation:
If we are able to get an accuracy score of 95%, A Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error between 0.0 and 0.5 Then our model is ready to go into production.
